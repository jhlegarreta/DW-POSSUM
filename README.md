This code enables the simulation of DW-MR data using the POSSUM simulator.

### Dependencies
* [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation)
* Python 2.x with [dipy](http://nipy.org/dipy/), [nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/), numpy and scipy

### Setup
1. Clone this repository 
2. Run `bash getFiles.sh` to download the imaging data


### Quick-start tutorial
DW-POSSUM is run in three stages. First all the files required for the simulation are generated (generateFileStructure.py). Then the simulations are run (runPossum.py). Finally everything is tidied up (postProcess.py). The following commands will simulate the acquistion of a single slice for the first three entries in the bval/bvec file supplied (two b=0 and one b=1000 volumes).

1. Generate required files 
```bash
./generateFileStructure.py Files/POSSUMdirectories/possumSimdirOneSlice/ Test/ Files/Bvalsbvecs/bvalsfmrib Files/Bvalsbvecs/bvecsfmrib --num_images 3
```

2. Run POSSUM
```bash
./runPossum.py Test 3
```

3. Tidy up
```bash
./postProcess.py Test 3 --noise_levels 0 0.0081 0.0165
```
Your simulations will be stored as 4D nifti files in Test/Results/. 

Documentation for each command can be found using the -h flag. 

### Computationalal requirements

* generateFileStructure.py is fairly memory hungry - it may require up to 16GB RAM. 
* runPossum.py is where the meat of the simulation happens, and is very CPU intensive. Under the hood, it calls the FSL command possumX. For large simulations (i.e. anything more than a few slices of the brain) I recommend running this on a cluster environment that has been set up for automatic self-submission of FSL jobs (more information [here](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/SGE%20submission%20FAQ)). This will automatically divide each simulation into a number of jobs (the number can be set using the --num_processors flag), submit each to the cluster and handle recombination into the final image volume.
